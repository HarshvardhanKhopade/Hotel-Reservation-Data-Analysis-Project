# Hotel Reservation Data Analysis project

Project Goal:
The aim of this project is to gain insights into the factors that affect hotel bookings and cancellations, and to identify patterns in customer behavior that could help the hotel optimize its operations and improve customer satisfaction.

1.What are the most popular room types and meal plans among customers?
2.How does the lead time (number of days between booking and arrival) affect the likelihood of cancellation?
3.What are the most common reasons for cancellation, and how can they be addressed to reduce the cancellation rate?
4.Are there any trends in booking patterns over time (e.g., seasonal variations, changes in market segments)?
5.What is the average revenue per reservation for a hotel?
6.What is the average revenue loss due to booking cancellations?
7.Which month do we lose the most revenue compared to the revenue we gain?
8.Analyze the average lead time of booking cancellations and non-cancellations in the month of December ?
9.How do the number of adults, children, and special requests influence the type of room and meal plan selected by customers?
10.What are the most popular days of the week and times of year for hotel bookings?
11.â€‹How do prices vary depending on the time of year, day of the week, and lead time?
12.What is the impact of being a repeated guest on booking behavior and cancellation rates?
13.How does the availability of car parking space affect the booking behavior of customers?

By answering these questions, you can provide valuable insights to the hotel management team, which could be used to improve their operations, enhance the customer experience, and increase revenue.
